    "# Using ehrapy with Large Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern health datasets can become very large. When datasets are so large they cannot be loaded into a computer's memory at once, loading and processing the data in batches becomes necessary. This is also called doing the computations \"out-of-core\".\n",
    "\n",
    "[Dask](https://www.dask.org) is a popular out-of-core, distributed array processing library that ehrapy is beginning to support.  Here we show how `dask` support in `ehrapy` can reduce the memory consumption of a simple ehrapy processing workflow.\n",

    "🔪 **Beware sharp edges!** 🔪\n",
    "\n",
    "`dask` support in `ehrapy` is new and highly experimental!\n",
    "\n",
    "Many functions in `ehrapy` **do not** support `dask` and may exhibit unexpected behaviour if dask arrays are passed to them. Stick to what's outlined in this tutorial and you should be fine!\n",

    "There are multiple features in `scalene`'s output, we show and focus on the key aspects here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time\n",
    "The required time for the profiled code to execute is displayed at the topmost \"% of time = 100.0%\". We can see that for the in-memory computation, the required wall time was 1 min 41 seconds, whereas for the out-of-core computation, the required wall time was 1 min 39 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the out-of-core computation can yield performance improvements by optimizing the scheduling of computations by using \"lazy execution\", for which you can find more information [here](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/scheduling.html). `Dask` also allows [distributed computations](https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/), providing even further speed improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beware that especially for small dataset or small chunk sizes, the overhead of such out-of-core computations can also exceed the gains obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we can see that the order of magnitude for execution time for both workflows is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maximum Memory Consumption\n",
    "The maximum required memory for the profiled code is displayed at the top right, on top of the \"Memory timeline\" plot.\n",
    "We can see that the maximum memory occupation for the in-memory computation was 2 GB, whereas for the out-of-core computation, the maximum memory occupation was 193 MB.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by leveraging the key idea behind `dask`, its [block-wise](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/array-chunks.html) (\"chunked\") computations. This means that `dask` accesses the data in chunks, not requiring the entire dataset to be loaded to memory at once.\n",
    "The size of the blocks is a tradeoff of having not too many small blocks (causing too much overhead) and not too big blocks (causing increased memory consumption and potentially less distributed computations). See [here](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/array-chunks.html) for a more detailed discussion on the block size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Here, we show with a synthetic dataset how out-of-core computations can reduce the memory requirements for a suite of analysis steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we have generated is small enough to not require out-of-core computations, so we can compare the in-memory and the out-of-core computation profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, in-memory computations are to be preferred whenever they are feasible, being easier to perform and omit potential pitfals such as using too small chunk sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have computed a PCA and can observe that the four underlying groups in our synthetic data form well separated clusters in the two-dimensional PCA projection, and are well clustered by Leiden clustering. \n",
