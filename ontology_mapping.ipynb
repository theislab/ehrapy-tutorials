    "Ontologies are structured and standardized representations of knowledge in a specific domain, defining the concepts, relationships, and properties within that domain. They matter for Electronic Health Records (EHR) as they provide a common vocabulary and framework for organizing and integrating healthcare data. By using ontologies, EHR systems can improve interoperability, semantic understanding, and facilitate effective data exchange, leading to enhanced decision support, data analysis, and collaboration among healthcare providers and also analysts."
